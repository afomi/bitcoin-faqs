### Security

##### If I am storing information on the blockchain how can I be certain it will be kept private and used for my business purposes only?

Bitcoin is based on a cryptographic protocol and digital signature scheme that helps ensure information is kept secure.

Depending on your business use case, design considerations still apply.

Multiple methods and features exist today to specify who has access to
data. Security is based on private and public keys, and these keys can
be configured in a variety of ways. For example, a common way to secure
a transaction is to enable only one user (e.g. your business) to access the data. Alternatively, `multisig` or multiple signature approaches can be used as well to specify that 2 or 2, or 2 of 3, or even n of 10 keys are required
to access data. And a public option exists, allowing data to be persisted on the blockchain in readable plain text, if so desired.
